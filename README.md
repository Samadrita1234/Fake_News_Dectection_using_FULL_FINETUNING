# Fake_News_Dectection_using_FULL_FINETUNING

ðŸ“° Fake News Detection (BERT-based)

This project implements a Fake News Detection system using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) along with NLP preprocessing and evaluation techniques. It classifies news articles as real or fake based on their text content.

ðŸš€ Features

Text preprocessing (stopword removal, regex cleaning).

Tokenization using BERT tokenizer.

Fine-tuning BERT for Sequence Classification.

Model training and evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Support for custom news input predictions.
